Cross-domain Requests
---------------------

In developing web applications it's commonplace to send and receive data
to APIs (Application Programmable Interfaces) that exist on other
domains. This cross-domain communication is often performed directly in
the browser, on the client-side using JavaScript. Cross-domain
communication can be accomplished using a server-side languages like
Python, Nodejs, PHP, etc., however for cases where responses from
cross-domain requests are utilized in the browser, JavaScript can save
time and simplify development. Addintionaly, JavaScript requests are
asynchronousâ€” meaning they can be run in parallel with other processes.
For example, JavaScript requests to other domains can be processed
asynchronously while the page is still loading.

Same-origin Policy
------------------

Same-origin policy is an important security concept in client-side
programming languages including JavaScript. This policy is observed by
all web browsers and limits scripts running on a site to only sending
requests with the same site. Browers use a combination of port number
(e.g. 80) and hostname (e.g. my.domain.com) to determine the scope of
the 'site'. There are however exceptions to the same-origin policy,
including using the HTML &lt;script&gt; tag to retreive a dynamically
generated JavaScript file from an external site. The most prominent of
method of exploiting this exception is JSONP.

JSON with Padding (JSONP)
-------------------------

JSONP uses the &lt;script&gt; tag to retreive remote JavaScript code
containing formatted JSON data with a function call wrapped around it.
The data is not parsed, rather it is evaluated by the JavaScript
interpreter.

A typical JSONP request may look like:

    <script type="application/javascript"
      src="http://remote.domain.com/data/?callback=jsonpcallback&id=123">
    </script>

The dynamicall generated JavaScript file may look like:

    jsonpcallback({
      "id": "123",
      "comments": "6",
      "name": "sample"
    });

The "padding" in JSONP refers to the function call that wraps the
formatted JSON object. This padding isn't always a function call. Though
not common, padding could also be a variable assignment:

    var data = {
      "id": "123",
      "comments": "6",
      "name": "sample"
    };

The purpose of the padding is to allow a means for the formatted data to
be put to use in the application.

jQuery for JSONP
----------------

The jQuery JavaScript library has functions to make using JSONP a
snap.[jQuery's
\$.ajax()](http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/working-with-jsonp/) function
will automatically handle &lt;script&gt; tag injection and response
handling (i.e. calling the 'callback' function).

    $.ajax({
      //JSONP API
      url: "http://remote.domain.com/data/?callback=jsonpcallback&id=123",
      //the name of the callback function
      jsonp: "jsonpcallback",
      //tell jQuery to expect JSONP
      dataType: "jsonp",
      //tell YQL what we want and that we want JSON
      data: {
        id: "123"
      },
      //work with the response
      success: function(data) {
        console.log(data); //formatted JSON data
      }
    });

`console.log(data);``{ "id": "123", "comments": "6", "name": "sample" }`

Alternatively, if jQuery is not available- which is often the case when
developing embeddable widgets- raw JavaScript can be used. The following
is minimal JSONP implementation:

    //callback function
    function jsonpcallback(data) {
        //do stuff with JSON
        console.log(data);
    }

    //create HTML script tag
    var script = document.createElement('script');
    script.src = "http://remote.domain.com/data/?callback=jsonpcallback&id=123"

    //inject script tag into head
    document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script);
